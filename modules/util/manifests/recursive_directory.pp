# == Define: recursive_directory
#
# This will create a directory recursively IF it has never been created
# before. This is useful if you're trying to create a directory before
# the actual software module creates it. More concrete example follows:
#
# Example: If you have a piece of software, let's say PostgreSQL, that needs
# a data directory. You configure that data directory to be at "/data/pg."
# The `postgresql` Puppet module creates this directory with the proper
# permissions and all that, BUT you want that directory to be an EBS-mounted
# directory. However, to `/sbin/mount` a directory, it needs to exist first!
# See the chicken and egg problem? This definition will use `mkdir -p` to
# recursively create the directories (as root) if it has to. After this,
# other Puppet resources are expected to set the proper owner/group later
# in the process.
